I'm Cameron Bale, a second year Ph.D. student in the Decision Sciences department at Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA. I have a broad background with training in economics, statistics, optimization, and computer science. 

I received a B.S. in Economics with a minor in Statistics from Brigham Young University Provo in 2019. During my time there, I worked with [Dr. Jeff Dotson](https://marriott.byu.edu/directory/details?id=33658) on a project examining the effects of [Category Captainship](https://www.dotactiv.com/blog/what-is-a-category-captain) for various retail product categories.


My research interests lie at the intersection of data privacy, statistics, and the law. My research takes a utility driven approach to maximize the usefulness of personal data while protecting the anonymity of data subjects. My advisor is [Dr. Matthew Schneider](https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/people/matthewschneider).



I began my Ph.D. training at Drexel in August of 2019. Since then, I have worked on multiple [projects](https://cdbale.github.io//research/) focused on data privacy. The first is a multi-disciplinary effort to design a mathematical framework to assess the robustness of anonymization methods from a legal perspective. The goal of this work is to help companies and organizations know how to legally anonymize their data while maintaining its usefulness for its intended purpose.
