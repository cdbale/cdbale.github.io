I'm Cameron Bale, a third year Ph.D. student in the Decision Sciences department at Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA. I have a broad background with training in economics, statistics, optimization, and computer science. I am a passionate researcher who loves to code, listen to music, lift weights, spend time outdoors, and relax with my wife and daughter.

## Research

My research interests lie at the intersection of data privacy, statistics, artificial intelligence, and the law. In general, I study and develop data anonymization methods that preserve data subjects' anonymity without severe reductions in data utility. 

I am currently working on multiple [projects](https://cdbale.github.io//research/). Two of these projects are focused on the intersection of data privacy legislation and mathematical privacy concepts. The [first](https://cdbale.github.io//research/working-paper-Legally-Anonymizing-Personal-Data) is a multi-disciplinary effort proposing a mathematical framework to assess the robustness of anonymization methods from a legal perspective. The goal of this work is to help companies and organizations know how to legally anonymize their data while maintaining its usefulness for its intended purpose. The focus of the second [project](https://cdbale.github.io//research/synthesizer-anonymized-location-data) is designing a statistical model and algorithm to generate privacy-preserving synthetic location data that is legally anonymous. Both of these papers help address the gap between legislative practice, which utilizes "reasonable" data protection approaches, and computer science theory, which focuses on maximizing theoretical guarantees of privacy (*i.e.,* differential privacy). Our results show that organizations can anonymize data such that it is legally compliant and still useful for analysis.

My second research stream focuses on protecting textual data and its accompanying structured data. I am working on two projects in this area. For the first [project](https://cdbale.github.io//research/Protecting-Anonymity-Bayesian-Data-Synthesis), we propose a sequential data synthesis model for protecting the structured data that accompanies user generated content (UGC) online. The second [project](https://cdbale.github.io//research/ETE-anon) proposes a reinforcement learning-based framework for anonymizing text. These synthesis models can be used to generate protected synthetic textual/structured data in many use cases, such as online review sites, stored search queries, teaching evaluations, and peer reviews for academic articles.

My final [project](https://cdbale.github.io//research/CC) is in another research area entirely and is a continuation of my RA work as an undergraduate student. We are examining the effects of [Category Captainship](https://www.dotactiv.com/blog/what-is-a-category-captain) for various retail product categories. Our results will have important implications for ongoing collaboration between retailers and product manufacturers in determining product assortment, product display layout, and ongoing relationships between the retailer and other category partners.

I am advised by [Dr. Matthew Schneider](https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/people/matthewschneider), whose feedback has been instrumental in guiding my research.

## Background

I received a B.S. in Economics with a minor in Statistics from Brigham Young University Provo in 2019. During my time there, I worked with [Dr. Jeff Dotson](https://marriott.byu.edu/directory/details?id=33658) on the previously mentioned Category Captainship project. I began my Ph.D. training at Drexel in August of 2019.
