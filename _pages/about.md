I'm Cameron Bale, a Ph.D. student in the Decision Sciences department at Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA. I have a broad background with training in economics, statistics, optimization, and computer science. My research interests lie at the intersection of data privacy, statistics, and the law. My research takes a utility driven approach to maximize the usefulness of personal data while protecting the anonymity of data subjects. My advisor is [Dr. Matthew Schneider](https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/people/matthewschneider).
