I'm Cameron Bale, a second year Ph.D. student in the Decision Sciences department at Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA. I have a broad background with training in economics, statistics, optimization, and computer science. I am a passionate researcher who loves to code, listen to music, lift weights, spend time outdoors, and relax with my wife and daughter.

## Research

My research interests lie at the intersection of data privacy, statistics, artificial intelligence, and the law. My research takes a utility driven approach to maximizing the usefulness of personal data while protecting the anonymity of data subjects. I am working on multiple [projects](https://cdbale.github.io//research/) in this area. The first is a multi-disciplinary effort to design a mathematical framework to assess the robustness of anonymization methods from a legal perspective. The goal of this work is to help companies and organizations know how to legally anonymize their data while maintaining its usefulness for its intended purpose. The focus of my second ongoing project is using a statistical model to generate privacy-preserving synthetic location data. My third ongoing project utilizes a combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning methods to anonymize textual data. I am advised by [Dr. Matthew Schneider](https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/people/matthewschneider), whose feedback has been instrumental in guiding my research.

## Background

I received a B.S. in Economics with a minor in Statistics from Brigham Young University Provo in 2019. During my time there, I worked with [Dr. Jeff Dotson](https://marriott.byu.edu/directory/details?id=33658) on a project examining the effects of [Category Captainship](https://www.dotactiv.com/blog/what-is-a-category-captain) for various retail product categories. This is an ongoing project, and our work so far can be viewed [here](https://github.com/marcdotson/category-captainship). I began my Ph.D. training at Drexel in August of 2019.
