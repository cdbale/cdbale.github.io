Abstract: "Much of the data that humans produce includes text data. While providing valuable insight in regards to data analysis, these data can pose a severe privacy risk to individuals, as well as violate data protection laws if not sufficiently anonymized. We propose a text anonymization framework that combines a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder model with a reinforcement learning agent. This agent learns to produce synthetic text that preserves the sentiment and protects the privacy of the original text."
