Abstract: "Forecasters often utilize large amounts of personal or commercially sensitive data. This data can be 
protected using privacy methods that mitigate privacy concerns and enable compliance with 
privacy laws and regulations. However, existing privacy methods degrade forecast accuracy to 
unusable levels. To overcome this problem, we propose a matrix-based privacy method called k-nearest time series + (k-nTS+) swapping that preserves time series features to maintain forecast 
accuracy. We apply our privacy method to a forecasting competition data set and find that k-nTS+ 
swapping maintains forecast accuracy and preserves the distribution of time series features much 
better than competitor methods at similar privacy levels. The k-nTS+ protected time series are also 
more representative of the original data, potentially leading to increased trust between data 
owners and forecasters. Using our approach, data owners can share representative time series data 
with useful features and significantly reduced privacy concerns. This can increase data availability 
to the forecasting community and give privacy-conscious data owners a competitive advantage."
