Abstract: "Recent research has shown the need for disclosure limitation methods that incorporate the legal criteria defining non-personal or anonymized data. This paper contains  a methodology for generating legally anonymized synthetic point process location data. This synthetic data can be released and stored in place of the original data, reducing privacy risk for individuals related to the data, and reducing the cost for companies to comply with privacy law. To illustrate our method, we anonymize COVID-19 patient location data from South Korea, and show that the underlying spatial relationships in the original data are preserved."
