Abstract: "User-generated content (UGC) is a modern form of communication that
combines multiple types of content such as text, video, audio, images, and
other data. However, privacy concerns emerge when online users of popular
UGC platforms are identified through a combination of their structured data
(e.g., location and name) and textual content (e.g., word choices and writing
style). To overcome this privacy problem, we develop a sequential synthesis
strategy to generate protected structured data based on a user's adjoining tex-
tual content in their UGC. The Bayesian data synthesis model enables platforms
to use a single shrinkage parameter to control the privacy level of their released
UGC data. Our results show that the sequential synthesis process decreases
the probability of identification of a user to an acceptable threshold while main-
taining much of the textual content present in the structured covariates. These
findings encourage UGC platforms that wish to be known for consumer privacy
to protect anonymity of their online users."
