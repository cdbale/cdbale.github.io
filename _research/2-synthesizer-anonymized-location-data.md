Abstract: "Data synthesis is a promising approach for generating protected data sets, especially in the face of increasing privacy concerns and legislation. However, the costs and expert knowledge required to implement and tune data synthesis models may prevent data owners from using synthesis as a disclosure limitation solution. In this paper, we study legal privacy criteria used to evaluate synthetic data and show that these criteria are met in expectation when the synthetic data is sampled from the same distribution as the confidential data. We propose a new sequential synthesis method that utilizes Bayesian optimization to tune synthesis models to approximate the data generating distribution. We also implement an algorithm that pairs with the proposed synthesis approach to reduce the probability of attribute disclosure for a sensitive binary variable. In an empirical application to South Korean COVID-19 location data, we find that the proposed synthesis method produces synthetic data with comparable privacy as measured by the legal criteria, reduced attributed disclosure risk, and better utility than a baseline method known to produce legally anonymous synthetic data."
