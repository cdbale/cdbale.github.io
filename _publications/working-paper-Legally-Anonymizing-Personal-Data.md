Abstract: "In the last decade, regions and countries adopted distinct data protection legislation to govern the collection and processing of personal data. Most of these legislative frameworks recognize that data can be personal and non-personal; but, variations in commonly used privacy terms create significant differences for legally anonymizing personal data. This complexity of privacy legislation necessitates a cohesive mathematical framework to assess compliance with privacy law. We propose a mathematical framework taken from regional privacy laws to convert personal data to non-personal data. We test our framework on two logical statistical solutions on geolocation data of COVID-19 patients in South Korea. We find that both solutions produced legally anonymized data, but with varied degrees of usefulness."
